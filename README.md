I wanted to be able to get song data from [NSF files](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/).

Seems the only way to do it reliably is to emulate a 6502.

We will focus on implementing [a subset of instructions](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_basics) for the most basic features related to producing audio.
